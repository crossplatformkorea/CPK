# Expo Starter with Router

[![CI](https://github.com/dooboolab-community/expo-router-starter/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dooboolab-community/expo-router-starter/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

The `expo` template generated with `dooboo-cli`.

We believe that the fastest way to build the app is using [Expo](https://expo.io).
You can create app even more easily with the cli tool [dooboo-cli](https://github.com/dooboolab-community/dooboo-cli).
